    <span class="head"><u>Why now</u></span><br>
 In Africa there are about 32 million orphans and very little orphanages to cater for all of them.
 Many of these kids have suffered all of their lives.These orphanages hardly have basic goods for all these kids due to lack of donations.
 We as a brand have found it worthwhile to make this project with over half of the profits going to orphans.
 The other half will be invested read utilities and roadmap for more information.
 These kids deserve a better life where they can learn , eat and sleep like we do.They are our future doctors, our future engineers and presidents.
 It all starts with you and me .Lets be an example to the rich people and build a better tommorrow with the little we have.
 We are all the mickey's of today, the leaders of today .</p>
